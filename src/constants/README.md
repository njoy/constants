# Physical Constants
Unlike mathematical constants, physical constants can change based on the current understanding and measurement capabilities of physics. Thus we can have different versions of the constants. 

The worldwide standard for the physical constants is maintained by [Committee on Data of the International Council for Science (CODATA)](https://www.codata.org). We have taken our physical constant values from their publication. For information about what values are maintained in this repository, see the respective README files:

- [CODATA2014](CODATA2014/README.md)
- CODATA2018 This should be published in 2019. We will update the repository after the publication.

For each CODATA release, we provide two maps; one for the data values and one for their associated uncertainty. The keys are the same in both maps. There are some physical constants that are defined to be exact (e.g., the speed of light). Their uncertainty, is, therefore, zero.
